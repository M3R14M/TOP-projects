    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Dutch mini pancakes, known as Poffertjes (pronounced poff-er-jes), are a popular street food snack. You’ll often find a stall roaming the markets in Amsterdam, Netherlands – especially at the popular Albert Cuyp Market. Made at home, they’re usually eaten at breakfast, as a snack or served for dessert.</p>

    <p>Fun fact: Poffertjes are also known in some areas of Indonesia due to their ties with Dutch heritage, but sold under the name Kue Cubit.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Instant yeast</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the flour, sugar and yeast, giving it a quick mix and making a well in the centre.</li>
        <li>Pour in the <b>warmed</b> milk and egg, then whisk into a batter. Cover with a tea towel or silicone bowl cover, and leave to rise for an hour. The batter should be double in size and look very bubbly when ready. <i>Note: If in a colder climate, allow extra time and pop the bowl in a warm location.</i></li>
        <li>Grease a poffertjes pan or frying pan with the butter over a medium heat. Once warmed, add heaped tablespoons of batter into each well in the poffertjes pan. Make sure to leave space if using a frying pan.</li>
        <li>Once bubbles start to pop on top (1-2 minutes), flip using a single chopstick or skewer (similar to making takoyaki). Allow to cook for another minute or two, once puffed up and cooked through, then remove from the pan. Repeat until all batter is used up.</li>
        <li>Serve while hot, sprinkling icing sugar / powdered sugar over the top to dust.</li>
    </ol>
